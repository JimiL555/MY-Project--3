My Project corrected code

Explanation:

collectEmployees: This function prompts the user to enter the number of employees and their details (first name, last name, and salary). It then creates an array of employee objects.

displayAverageSalary: This function calculates the average salary from the employees array and displays it in a designated HTML element with the ID #average-salary.

getRandomEmployee: This function selects a random employee from the employees array and displays their details in a designated HTML element with the ID #random-employee.

displayEmployees: This function (already provided) displays the employee data in an HTML table.

trackEmployeeData: This function calls the above functions to collect employees, display the average salary, display employees in a table, and display a random employee.

Event Listener: Added an event listener to the button with the ID #add-employees-btn to trigger trackEmployeeData when clicked.
